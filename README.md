FC emulator on the blockchain

In this project, we aim to build an FC (Family Computer) emulator that runs on a blockchain network. Players can connect to the blockchain node and start playing retro games in a decentralized environment. The PPU (Picture Processing Unit) data will be encoded into video streams and sent to players through the network. By leveraging the advantages of blockchain, we can provide players with a transparent and secure gaming experience. Moreover, this project opens up opportunities for building a decentralized gaming ecosystem, where players can trade and own in-game assets in a transparent and secure way.
